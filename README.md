## Overview

This module provides a RESTful API client for CloudvisionÂ® Portal (CVP) which can be used for building applications that work with Arista CVP.

There are two pieces to go-cvprac:

* api - Provides all the formated request/response to CVP in a nice to use interface.
* client - Client implementation using the API.

If you would like to spin your own version of a client, then you only need to implement the API interface.

## Requirements

* Go 1.6.3+

## Installation
First, it is assumed you have a standard Go workspace, as described in http://golang.org/doc/code.html, with proper GOPATH set.

Please refer section [Versioning](#versioning) for detailed info.

To download and install go-cvprac:

```bash
$ go get gopkg.in/aristanetworks/go-cvprac
```

After setting up Go and installing go-cvprac, any required build tools can be installed by bootstrapping your environment via:

```bash
$ make bootstrap
```

## Upgrading

```bash
$ go get -u gopkg.in/aristanetworks/go-cvprac
```

## Usage

Basic usage:

The included client can be used to connect/interact with CVP:

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"gopkg.in/aristanetworks/go-cvprac.v1/client"
)

func main() {
	hosts := []string{"10.81.110.85"}
	cvpClient, _ := client.NewCvpClient(
		client.Protocol("https"),
		client.Port(443),
		client.Hosts(hosts...),
		client.Debug(false))

	if err := cvpClient.Connect("cvpadmin", "cvp123"); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("ERROR: %s", err)
	}

	// verify we have at least one device in inventory
	data, err := cvpClient.API.GetCvpInfo()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("ERROR: %s", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Data: %v\n", data)
}
```

If you want to use your own client (to leverage some custom behavior), you merely need to implement the provided ClientInterface:

```golang
type ClientInterface interface {
	Get(string, *url.Values) ([]byte, error)
	Post(string, *url.Values, interface{}) ([]byte, error)
}
```

You then can access/interact with CVP using your clients underlying behavior. Example:

```golang
import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"gopkg.in/aristanetworks/go-cvprac.v1/api"
)

type YourCustomClient struct {
  ...
}
func NewYourCustomClient(host string) *YourCustomClient {
  ...
}
func (c *YourCustomClient) Get(url string, params *url.Values) ([]byte, error) {
  ...
}
func (c *YourCustomClient) Post(url string, params *url.Values, data interface{}) ([]byte, error) {
  ...
}

yourClient := NewYourCustomClient("10.10.1.2")
cvpClient := cvpapi.NewCvpRestAPI(yourClient)
cvpClient.Login(user, passwd)

```

## Development

Please refer to Contributing section on contribution guidelines.
To install the needed packages for lint/vet/etc. run the bootstrap provided:

```bash
$ make bootstrap
```

## Testing

The go-cvprac library provides various tests. To run System specific tests, you will need to update the cvp_node.gcfg file (found in api/) to include CVP specifics/credentials for your setup.

**System Test Requirements**:

* Need one CVP node for test with a test user account. Create the same account on the switch used for testing.
* Test has dedicated access to the CVP node.
* CVP node contains at least one device in a container.
* Container or device has at least one configlet applied.

For running System tests, issue the following from the root of the go-cvprac directory:

```bash
$ make systest
```

Similarly, Unit tests can be run via:

```bash
$ make unittest
```

Note: Test cases live in respective XXX_test.go files and have the following function signature:

Unit Tests: TestXXX_UnitTest(t *testing.T){...
System Tests: TestXXX_SystemTest(t *testing.T){...

Any tests written must conform to this standard.

## Versioning

Releases are done according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

* gopkg.in/aristanetworks/go-cvprac.v{X} points to appropriate tagged versions; {X} denotes version series number and it's a stable release for production use. For e.g. gopkg.in/arsitanetworks/go-cvprac.v1
